The OSC Docs website is a source of truth for projects and club activity at the University of Florida's Open Source Club. More specifically, it hosts user and developer documentation for the various projects started each semester. This project uses [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/) to quickly and conveniently generate static sites from [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/) files.

Unlike the [main OSC website](https://ufosc.org), the docs website emphasizes content delivery, accessibility, and ease of content creation (especially for non-technical users). This is beyond the capabilities and scope of the main site's native content management system, hence the need for a separate documentation site.

The source code is available on the Open Source Club's [GitHub page](https://github.com/ufosc) under the [AGLP-3.0-or-later](https://spdx.org/licenses/AGPL-3.0-or-later) license, and the site is hosted at [docs.ufosc.org](https://docs.ufosc.org). To get started with contributing to the osc docs, start by [installing the project](/docs/osc-docs/installation).
